## Usage

To crawl and download data from http://luftdaten.info by yourself, look at the `data_preparation.py` script.

If you want to use the data we used, pull it from our [dvc](http://dataversioncontrol.com/) remote with `dvc pull`.

Always execute python commands from the root folder, e.g. `python golddust/...`
